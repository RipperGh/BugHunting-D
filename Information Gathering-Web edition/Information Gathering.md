# Information Gathering 

The information gathering phase is the first step in every penetration test where we need to simulate external attackers without internal information from the target organization. This phase is crucial as poor and rushed information gathering could result in missing flaws that otherwise thorough enumeration would have uncovered.

This phase helps us understand the attack surface, technologies used, and, in some cases, discover development environments or even forgotten and unmaintained infrastructure that can lead us to internal network access as they are usually less protected and monitored. Information gathering is typically an iterative process. As we discover assets (say, a subdomain or virtual host), we will need to fingerprint the technologies in use, look for hidden pages/directories, etc., which may lead us to discover another subdomain and start the process over again.

For example, we can think of it as stumbling across new subdomains during one of our penetration tests based on the SSL certificate. However, if we take a closer look at these subdomains, we will often see different technologies in use than the main company website. Subdomains and vhosts are used to present other information and perform other tasks that have been separated from the homepage. Therefore, it is essential to find out which technologies are used, what purpose they serve, and how they work. During this process, our objective is to identify as much information as we can from the following areas:

We can break the information gathering process into two main categories:

It is crucial to keep the information that we collect well-organized as we will need various pieces of data as inputs for later phasing of the testing process. Depending on the type of assessment we are performing, we may need to include some of this enumeration data in our final report deliverable (such as an External Penetration Test). When writing up a bug bounty report, we will only need to include details relevant specifically to the bug we are reporting (i.e., a hidden subdomain that we discovered led to the disclosure of another subdomain that we leveraged to obtain remote code execution (RCE) against our target).

It is worth signing up for an account at Hackerone, perusing the program list, and choosing a few targets to reproduce all of the examples in this module. Practice makes perfect. Continuously practicing these techniques will help us hone our craft and make many of these information gathering steps second nature. As we become more comfortable with the tools and techniques shown throughout this module, we should develop our own, repeatable methodology. We may find that we like specific tools and command-line techniques for some phases of information gathering and discover different tools that we prefer for other phases. We may want to write out our own scripts to automate some of these phases as well.

# Moving On
Let's move on and discuss passive information gathering. For the module section examples and exercises, we will focus on Facebook, which has its own bug bounty program, PayPal, Tesla, and internal lab hosts. While performing the information gathering examples, we must be sure not to stray from the program scope, which lists in-scope and out-of-scope websites and applications and out-of-scope attacks such as physical security attacks, social engineering, the use of automated vulnerability scanners, man-in-the-middle attacks, etc.
