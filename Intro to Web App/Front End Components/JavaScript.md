# JavaScript 

JavaScript is one of the most used languages in the world. It is mostly used for web development and mobile development. JavaScript is usually used on the front end of an application to be executed within a browser. Still, there are implementations of back end JavaScript used to develop entire web applications, like NodeJS.

While HTML and CSS are mainly in charge of how a web page looks, JavaScript is usually used to control any functionality that the front end web page requires. Without JavaScript, a web page would be mostly static and would not have much functionality or interactive elements.

### Example

JavaScript code is loaded with the <script> tag, as follows:
```
Code: html
<script type="text/javascript">
..JavaScript code..
</script>
```
A web page can also load remote JavaScript code with src and the script's link, as follows:
```
<script src="./script.js"></script>
```
An example of basic use of JavaScript within a web page is the following:
```
Code: javascript
document.getElementById("button1").innerHTML = "Changed Text!";
```
# Usage 

common web applications heavily rely on JavaScript to drive all needed functionality on the web page, like updating the web page view in real-time, dynamically updating content in real-time, accepting and processing user input, and many other potential functionalities.

JavaScript is also used to automate complex processes and perform HTTP requests to interact with the back end components and send and retrieve data, through technologies like Ajax.

JavaScript is also often used alongside CSS, as previously mentioned, to drive advanced animations that would not be possible with CSS alone. Whenever we visit an interactive and dynamic web page that uses many advanced and visually appealing animations, we are seeing the result of active JavaScript code running on our browser.

# Frameworks
 JavaScript to develop an entire web application from scratch. This is why a host of JavaScript frameworks have been introduced to improve the experience of web application development.

 introduce libraries that make it very simple to re-create advanced functionalities like user login and user registration, and they introduce new technologies based on existing ones, like the use of dynamically changing HTML code, instead of using static HTML code.

 Some of the most common front end JavaScript frameworks are:
  - Angular
  - React
  - Vue
  - jQuery
