# CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the stylesheet language used alongside HTML to format and set the style of HTML elements. Like HTML, there are several versions of CSS, and each subsequent version introduces a new set of capabilities that can be used for formatting HTML elements. Browsers are updated alongside it to support these new features.

## Example 

CSS is used to define the style of each class or type of HTML elements (i.e., body or h1), such that any element within that page would be represented as defined in the CSS file. This could include the font family, font size, background color, text color and alignment, and more.

```
Code: css
body {
  background-color: black;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: helvetica;
  font-size: 10px;
}
```

# Syntax
CSS defines the style of each HTML element or class between curly brackets {}, within which the properties are defined with their values (i.e. element { property : value; }).

Each HTML element has many properties that can be set through CSS, such as height, position, border, margin, padding, color, text-align, font-size, and hundreds of other properties. All of these can be combined and used to design visually appealing web pages.


# Frameworks

CSS to be difficult to develop. In contrast, others may argue that it is inefficient to manually set the style and design of all HTML elements in each web page. This is why many CSS frameworks have been introduced, which contain a collection of CSS style-sheets and designs, to make it much faster and easier to create beautiful HTML elements.

Furthermore, these frameworks are optimized for web application usage. They are designed to be used with JavaScript and for wide use within a web application and contain elements usually required within modern web applications. Some of the most common CSS frameworks are:
  - Bootstrap
  - SASS
  - Foundation
  - Bulma
  - Pure
